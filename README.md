# Sample Missions

This is a mission system, you can use this to build your own missions.

## Usage

```
docker-compose up
```

This will spin up a composer container to serve this at http://localhost:1080.
From there you will see the existing missions from the `missions/` folder.
You can easily create you own mission folder within that folder.

Upon mission submission, please ZIP the folder and send it my way.

Thanks.
